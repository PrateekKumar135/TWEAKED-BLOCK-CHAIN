## Introduction

The project focuses on three main components:

1. **Tweaked Blockchain**: A simple implementation of a blockchain system with a twist, demonstrating the concept of an immutable and distributed ledger.
2. **AES Encryption**: Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for secure data encryption and decryption.
3. **RSA Encryption**: Implementation of the RSA cryptosystem for public-key encryption and digital signatures.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```

```

- `blockchain/`: Contains the implementation and documentation for the Tweaked Blockchain component.
- `encryption/`: Contains the implementation and documentation for AES and RSA encryption components.
- `report/`: Contains the project report in PDF format, detailing the theoretical background, implementation, and results.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages for running the project.

## Tweaked Blockchain

The Tweaked Blockchain implementation demonstrates the basic concepts of a blockchain system, such as creating blocks, hashing data, and chaining blocks together. Additionally, it incorporates a twist or modification to the traditional blockchain structure, which is explained in detail in the project report.

## AES Encryption

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used symmetric-key encryption algorithm. This project implements AES encryption and decryption using various modes of operation, such as Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC). The implementation provides a secure way to encrypt and decrypt data using a shared secret key.

## RSA Encryption

The RSA cryptosystem is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm. This project implements RSA encryption and decryption, as well as digital signatures. The implementation demonstrates how to generate public and private key pairs, encrypt data with the public key, and decrypt data with the private key. Additionally, it shows how to create and verify digital signatures using the RSA algorithm.

## Installation

To run the project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system.
